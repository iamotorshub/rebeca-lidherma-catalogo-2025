The previous AI engineer began by establishing the Rebeca Beauty Store frontend with a pastel, delicate, and modern aesthetic, building core components like navigation, product display, and a hero carousel using mock data. A significant pivot occurred at Chat Message 43, where the user requested an exact replica of a Lovable design, specifying a new color palette, typography, and precise CSS for product cards and responsive grids. The engineer successfully implemented this new design, including removing a distracting white overlay from the hero carousel. However, recurrent issues with product image accuracy and incorrect carousel images persisted. The engineer then focused on iteratively populating  with 112 products from a CSV, systematically correcting misalignments and adding real image URLs from Google Drive, eventually completing all 112 products. The most recent interactions (Chat Message 145) indicate that the carousel images are still incorrect, and a full, line-by-line verification of all 112 products and their images directly from  is required, overriding previous image sourcing.

The user requires an e-commerce platform, Rebeca Beauty Store, for LIDHERMA professional cosmetics. Initially, a pixel-perfect replica of Lidherma's official site was requested, which evolved into a pastel, delicate, and modern aesthetic. This was later superseded by a requirement for an **exact replica of a Lovable design** (Chat Message 43), featuring a specific palette (#2d5aa0, #e63946), 'Inter' font, and detailed CSS for product cards (rounded, soft shadow, dual pricing, hover effects), responsive grids, and header.

Key features include:
- **Product Data**: Integration of 112 LIDHERMA products from a CSV, with 69 real Google Drive image URLs and 43 temporary placeholders. The latest requirement emphasizes 100% verification from  for all product data and images.
- **Homepage**: Hero carousel (originally 5 specific banners, later clarified to use original captures from user), Most Sold section, Consult with Rebeca CTA (virtual/presencial only), and detailed footer (specific email, Instagram, WhatsApp).
- **Functionality**: Intelligent fuzzy search, dynamic filters (lines, categories, price, type, availability), comprehensive state management (Product, Cart, User, UI Contexts), WhatsApp checkout flow, dynamic meta tags for SEO, Google Analytics 4, and performance optimizations.
- **Specific Sections**: Visually appealing Uber Delivery section (real map image, animated text), accordion-style FAQ (6 questions), Payment Methods display.
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive design across various breakpoints, hamburger menu, slide-out cart.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical user feedback from Chat Message 145. The user explicitly stated that the most recently updated carousel images (sourced from ) were incorrect and that the carousel should instead use previous captures provided by the user. Furthermore, the user emphasized that a significant number of product images and data in  were still inaccurate, even after the catalog of 112 products was completed.

The AI engineer acknowledged this, apologizing for the confusion (Chat 147), and began the systematic process of **re-extracting and verifying all product data (including ) line by line directly from **. This is a comprehensive effort to ensure 100% data accuracy for all 112 products. The last actions (Chat 148, 149, 150, 151) show the engineer successfully exploring the  site, identifying product lines, and specifically starting the extraction process with the Hyaluronic 4D line.

The current state is that the primary focus is on this systematic data re-verification from the official Lidherma website to populate . The task of reverting the carousel images to the user's captures has been identified but not yet executed, as the focus immediately shifted to product data verification.

<optional_next_step>
First, correct the hero carousel to use the original user-provided capture images, then continue the systematic extraction of product data (especially ) for the Hyaluronic 4D line and subsequent lines from  to verify and update .

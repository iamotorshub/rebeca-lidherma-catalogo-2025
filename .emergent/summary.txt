The previous AI engineerâ€™s work began with frontend styling (Rebeca Beauty Store pastel theme), then pivoted significantly to replicating a Lovable design with specific colors and typography, fixing product card and carousel styling. A major ongoing task involved populating  with 112 product entries, systematically correcting image URLs and data by cross-referencing . This process was iterative and faced challenges with image accuracy. More recently, structural issues were introduced when  was heavily modified, breaking several frontend components. These were diligently fixed. The most recent focus has been on integrating a new CSV of 298 products, ensuring all product/line names are in English, and correcting image URLs to specifically use  to prevent broken images. The engineer is currently in the process of mass-correcting these URLs after user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an e-commerce platform, Rebeca Beauty Store, for LIDHERMA professional cosmetics, designed as an exact replica of a Lovable design. The aesthetic includes a palette of #2d5aa0 and #e63946, 'Inter' font, and specific CSS for product cards and responsive grids. The platform needs to support 298 products from a provided CSV, with product and line names in English, and validated image URLs from . It should include a homepage with a hero carousel (using user-provided captures), Most Sold section, Consult with Rebeca CTA, and a detailed footer. Functionality includes intelligent fuzzy search, dynamic filters, state management, WhatsApp checkout, SEO, and performance optimizations. The design must be mobile-first, featuring a hamburger menu and slide-out cart. The store is an *internal/extra* functionality, not a replacement for the official Lidherma site.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical user feedback regarding broken image URLs. The user explicitly stated that the  file, which was recently updated with 298 products from a new CSV and names corrected to English, still contained incorrect image URLs. Specifically, the user clarified that the URLs that are good are the ones that start with .

The AI engineer acknowledged this and is in the process of mass-correcting all image URLs in  to adhere to the  prefix, while also checking for broken images. This follows a previous bug where extensive modifications to  led to frontend errors due to missing exported constants, which were successfully resolved. The hero carousel images were already updated to user-provided captures.
